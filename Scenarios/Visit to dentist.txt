Mark has an appointement with the dentist this afternoon. He doesn`n have the car because
his wife takes it for shopping.
Mark decides to books a PowerEnjoy car. Mark logs into the mobile app, search for a car near him 
and reserves a car with 100% the battery very near him!
When Mark is near the car, he opens the car with the mobile app, ignites the engine and starts to drive.
When Mark is near to the dentist sees on the map of the car, that near the dentist there is a power grid station,
so he decides to park there. Before getting of the car, Mark sees on the car screen the amount of payment
for the trip, but he knows that there will be a discount of 50% because Mark will recharge the car and also she left the car 
with 70% battery full. 
Mark plugs the car and goes to the dentist. After 3 minutes he recive an e-mail from his bank that says the paymente 
for PowerEnjoy goes fine and also an e-mail from PowerEnjoy for the bill.
Mark is surprise for the bill because the discount is only of 30%, but Mark now remembers that only the bigger discount 
is take.
