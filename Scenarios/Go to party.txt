Gina and Marika are best friends and this evening they have an halloween party.
They don`t have cars but Gina is a PowerEnyoy`s user, so they decide to book a car.
So she Logs, searches for a car with her smartphone, and books a car under her house.
Marika reaches Gina`s house, and after a few minutes, they open the car and start driving for the party.
About twenty minutes later they reach the party place and so they start to search for a park.
Unfortunately they see on the map of the screen, that the park they find is very far from a power grid station.
After 3 minutes the e-mails from the bank and the PowerEnjoy arrives and the bill is very huge because there is
a 30% fee for the more than 3km distance from nearest power grid, and there wasn`t the discount of the 
two people in the machine because if there are fee and discount, only the fee is take into consideration.
So with money less they go to the party, knowing that they will drink less.
